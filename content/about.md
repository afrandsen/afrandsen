My name is Andreas Frandsen. You can read more about me on my homepage and my vitae. This blog is about R, bikes and training. All my opinions here are my own, so I ain't representing anyone else. I feel good when contributing to open-source software that I use often, either through pull requests or direct contact to the author(s).
