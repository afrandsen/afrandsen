<p class="firstpara">Recently I made a subdomain request, [#449](https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/449), to [rbind/support](https://github.com/rbind/support), it got accepted the following day and I received the subdomain I opted for: [afrandsen.rbind.io](https://afrandsen.rbind.io). You can read more about the Rbind project [here](https://support.rbind.io/).</p>
