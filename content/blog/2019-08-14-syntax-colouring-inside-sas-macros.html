<p>This slight hack is a way to bypass how SAS syntax colouring behaves inside a macro, for the SAS Enhanced Editor.</p>
<div id="tip-regarding-syntax-colouring-in-macros" class="section level2">
<h2>Tip Regarding Syntax Colouring in Macros</h2>
<p>I have always been annoyed by the fact that code inside a SAS macro isn’t syntax coloured.</p>
<pre><code>%macro colourless;
    data noColour;
    set someData;
    run;
%mend;</code></pre>
<p>Even though you can’t see it here, the above code block would have the same syntax colour for all its elements.</p>
<p>There is a slight hack that can help you! All you have to do is create an empty dummy macro inside the original macro. Just like this.</p>
<pre><code>%macro colourful;
    %macro disableTheDarkSide;
    %mend disableTheDarkSide;

    data colour;
    set someColourfulData;
    run;
%mend;</code></pre>
<p>This essentially give you the syntax colouring defined in <code>Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Enhanced Editor</code> back. This makes me happy and maybe also you. If you don’t know how to change the theme that controls the syntax colouring then check my blog posts out <a href="https://afrandsen.rbind.io/blog/2019/08/12/sas-9-4-enhanced-editor-custom-theme/">SAS 9.4 Enhanced Editor Custom Theme</a>. But don’t fool yourself, SAS sees these nested macros as unexpected behaviour, and will maybe apply a fix<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> sooner or later.</p>
