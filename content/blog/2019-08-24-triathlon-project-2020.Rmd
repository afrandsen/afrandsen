description: "Triathlon build part I. Hambini BB86 Racing Edition bottom bracket. Blog post from afrandsen."

For the upcoming year I have a build planned. I have set my main target on the Giant Trinity Advanced frame, which has shown to be world championship worthy, even with a few years on its back. This blog post and the following parts will show the main components that will form my build.

## Hambini BB86 Racing Edition -- Black

I opted for the Hambini bottom bracket after seeing Hambini's [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/nrgizerbunny/videos) and [blog posts](https://www.hambini.com/blog/) over several years. I like his engineering insights in aerodynamics, bearings, materials etc. In August I contacted him regarding the [BB86 Racing Edition](https://www.hambini.com/bottom-brackets/bb86-bike-frames/bb86-to-shimano-racing-edition-black-bottom-bracket.html) bottom bracket he produce, unfortunatly it was out of stock, but Hambini was very friendly and put one aside for me when he produced the next batch.

It was sent during a weekend!^[&#128077;.] And after a few days I received it and the included fitting adaptors. It's one piece design looks smooth. It feels very well made, even though I have no experience in judging what well made is, for this particular type of component. I have high beliefs that it's design will end the days of bottom bracket creaking.^[I have never tried the so called japanese “creak fixer” Wakos Brake Protector, because I can't find it in Europe.] The shell is made from heat treated alloy.

The bottom bracket is equipped with so called Super Precision Ultra Low friction bearings from either NTN, SKF or NSK. Which all are top tier bearing brands, from what I can understand. The bearings can be removed and serviced as well. The bottom bracket has delrin sleeves installed, which can be removed when needed.

Hambini produces the Racing Edition in the following colours: silver, black and orange, though the orange version is missing from the website as of today. I opted for the black version given the fact that it shall be paired with the Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset.

Hambini's own findings show that the average power consumption over 5000 kilometers is $\approx$ 0.5 watts for the Racing Edition. And that the bottom bracket stiffness is $\approx$ 600 N/deg. Thus the Hambini Racing Edition outperform several well established brands such as CeramicPoops. You can read more about his testing conditions on his website.

I look forward to the day it gets installed in the Trinity frame. But for now I still need a lot of components, including the frame. If you want to buy a Hambini bottom bracket make sure that you check which version you need^[Contact Hambini and he will be fast to respond if you are in doubt.]. I have only ridden bikes with the BB86 standard, but many other standards exists. The general installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.hambini.com/technical-support/hambini-bottom-bracket-installation.html).

Next up I take a look at the new Continental Grand Prix 5000's!
