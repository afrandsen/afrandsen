description: "Triathlon build part I. Hambini BB86 Racing Edition bottom bracket. Blog post from afrandsen."
---



<p>For the upcoming year I have a build planned. I have set my main target on the Giant Trinity Advanced frame, which has shown to be world championship worthy, even with a few years on its back. This blog post and the following parts will show the main components that will form my build.</p>
<div id="hambini-bb86-racing-edition-black" class="section level2">
<h2>Hambini BB86 Racing Edition ‚Äì Black</h2>
<p>I opted for the Hambini bottom bracket after seeing Hambini‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nrgizerbunny/videos">YouTube videos</a> and <a href="https://www.hambini.com/blog/">blog posts</a> over several years. I like his engineering insights in aerodynamics, bearings, materials etc. In August I contacted him regarding the <a href="https://www.hambini.com/bottom-brackets/bb86-bike-frames/bb86-to-shimano-racing-edition-black-bottom-bracket.html">BB86 Racing Edition</a> bottom bracket he produce, unfortunatly it was out of stock, but Hambini was very friendly and put one aside for me when he produced the next batch.</p>
<p>It was sent during a weekend!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> And after a few days I received it and the included fitting adaptors. It‚Äôs one piece design looks smooth. It feels very well made, even though I have no experience in judging what well made is, for this particular type of component. I have high beliefs that it‚Äôs design will end the days of bottom bracket creaking.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The shell is made from heat treated alloy.</p>

<p>The bottom bracket is equipped with so called Super Precision Ultra Low friction bearings from either NTN, SKF or NSK. Which all are top tier bearing brands, from what I can understand. The bearings can be removed and serviced as well. The bottom bracket has delrin sleeves installed, which can be removed when needed.</p>
<p>Hambini produces the Racing Edition in the following colours: silver, black and orange, though the orange version is missing from the website as of today. I opted for the black version given the fact that it shall be paired with the Shimano Ultegra R8000 groupset.</p>

<p>Hambini‚Äôs own findings show that the average power consumption over 5000 kilometers is <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 0.5 watts for the Racing Edition. And that the bottom bracket stiffness is <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 600 N/deg. Thus the Hambini Racing Edition outperform several well established brands such as CeramicPoops. You can read more about his testing conditions on his website.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day it gets installed in the Trinity frame. But for now I still need a lot of components, including the frame. If you want to buy a Hambini bottom bracket make sure that you check which version you need.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I have only ridden bikes with the BB86 standard, but many other standards exists. The general installation instructions can be found <a href="https://www.hambini.com/technical-support/hambini-bottom-bracket-installation.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Next up I take a look at some GPS mounts.</p>
